# Geospatial interactive Visualization

The project demonstrates an interactive map created with Python and Jupyter Notebook. The map visualizes available number of places in clubs for seniors in each commune in Poland per 1000 inhabitants.


# Features

- Interactive Map: Visualizes the number of places in senior clubs per 1,000 inhabitants for each commune.
- Custom Styling: Unique styling for both communes and voivodeships, with tooltips and a dynamic color scale based on senior club availability.
- Data Preparation: Comprehensive data cleaning and merging of multiple datasets, including population data and geo-spatial boundaries.
- Areas for Improvement: Suggestions for refining the analysis, such as calculating availability based on the senior population instead of the general population.
- Libraries Used: Folium, Pandas, GeoPandas, and Branca.
